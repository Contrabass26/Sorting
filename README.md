# Sorting

This project attempts to visualise various sorting algorithms by representing each item in the array as a bar on screen.
Currently implemented algorithms:
  - Bubble sort
  - Insertion sort
  - Merge sort
More may be added in the future.

After each step in the algorithm, there is a short delay to make the sorting visible on screen. The length of this delay
can be adjusted using the mouse wheel, and is displayed in the bottom right hand corner.

The size of the data set can also be changed via the text box in the bottom right hand corner. Values above 319 cause
nothing to be displayed at all but will not crash the application. Values below one will be interpreted as one.

This project was inspired by a YouTube video from Timo Bingmann:
